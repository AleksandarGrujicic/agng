✨ A production-ready Angular monorepo showcasing key [Nx](https://nx.dev) features ✨

## 📦 Project Overview

This repository contains an investment dashboard application with organized shared libraries following Nx best practices:

- **1 Application**

  - `investing` - Investment calculator and dashboard application

- **2 Feature Libraries (Investing Scope)**

  - `@investing/calculator` - Investment calculator feature
  - `@investing/dashboard` - Dashboard feature

- **2 Shared Libraries (Shared Scope)**

  - `@shared/ui` - UI component library with shell layout (header, footer, sidebar, layout)
  - `@shared/utils` - Utility functions and data access helpers

- **E2E Testing**
  - `investing-e2e` - Playwright tests for the investing application

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-fork-url>
cd <your-repository-name>

# Install dependencies
# (Note: You may need --legacy-peer-deps)
npm install

# Serve the investing application
npx nx serve investing

# Build all projects
npx nx run-many -t build

# Run tests
npx nx run-many -t test

# Lint all projects
npx nx run-many -t lint

# Run e2e tests
npx nx run investing-e2e:e2e

npx nx run-many -t lint test build --parallel=3

# Visualize the project graph
npx nx graph
```

## ⭐ Featured Nx Capabilities

This repository showcases several powerful Nx features:

### 1. 🔒 Module Boundaries

Enforces architectural constraints using tags. The repository follows a strict dependency model:

- `scope:shared` - Shared UI components used by all projects
- `scope:investing` - Investing-specific feature libraries
- `type:feature` - Feature libraries
- `type:ui` - UI component libraries
- `type:e2e` - End-to-end testing projects

**Try it out:**

```bash
# See the current project graph and dependencies
npx nx graph

# View a specific project's details
npx nx show project investing --web
```

### 2. 📊 Organized Scope-Based Architecture

Libraries are organized by feature scope with clear, multi-level dependencies:

**Shared Scope** (`libs/shared/`)
- `ui` - UI components and shell layout components
- `utils` - Shared utilities and data access functions

**Investing Scope** (`libs/investing/`)
- `calculator` - Investment calculator feature
- `dashboard` - Dashboard display feature

**Dependency Rules:**
- Applications and feature libraries in `scope:investing` can depend on `@shared/*` and other `@investing/*` libraries
- `@shared/*` libraries can only depend on other `@shared/*` libraries
- All scope:shared libraries are available to all consuming projects

### 3. 🎭 Playwright E2E Testing

End-to-end testing with Playwright is pre-configured:

```bash
# Run e2e tests
npx nx e2e shop-e2e

# Run e2e tests in CI mode
npx nx e2e-ci shop-e2e
```

### 4. ⚡ Vitest for Unit Testing

Fast unit testing with Vite for Angular libraries:

```bash
# Test a specific library
npx nx test data

# Test all projects
npx nx run-many -t test
```

### 5. 🔧 Self-Healing CI

The CI pipeline includes `nx fix-ci` which automatically identifies and suggests fixes for common issues:

```bash
# In CI, this command provides automated fixes
npx nx fix-ci
```

This feature helps maintain a healthy CI pipeline by automatically detecting and suggesting solutions for:

- Missing dependencies
- Incorrect task configurations
- Cache invalidation issues
- Common build failures

## 🏷️ Understanding Tags

This repository uses tags to enforce module boundaries:

| Project            | Tags                         | Can Import From              |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| `shop`             | `scope:shop`                 | `scope:shop`, `scope:shared` |
| `api`              | `scope:api`                  | `scope:api`, `scope:shared`  |
| `feature-products` | `scope:shop`, `type:feature` | `scope:shop`, `scope:shared` |
| `data`             | `scope:shop`, `type:data`    | `scope:shared`               |
| `models`           | `scope:shared`, `type:data`  | Nothing (base library)       |

## 🎯 Adding New Features

### Generate a new Angular application:

```bash
npx nx g @nx/angular:app my-app
```

### Generate a new Angular library:

```bash
npx nx g @nx/angular:lib my-lib
```

### Generate a new Angular component:

```bash
